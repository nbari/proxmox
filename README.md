## Mount disk and wipefs

To reinstall (preseed) a VM, you need to mount the disk and wipe it:

```bash
rbd map tank/vm-114-disk-0
/dev/rdb0
```

> this will mount disk in something like `/dev/rdb0`

Then wipe the disk:

```bash
wipefs -a /dev/rbd/tank/vm-114-disk-0
```

And unmap the disk:

```bash
rbd unmap tank/vm-114-disk-0
```
